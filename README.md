## 👤 About Me

Hi, I’m **Fady**!

I decided to learn programming because I’m genuinely passionate about it. I’m not planning to change careers, but I wanted to challenge myself and grow by picking up coding alongside my day job and dad duties.

While my code may look rough at times, I’m fully committed to learning and improving. I’m currently building this project while at **92% completion of The Odin Project Foundation course**.

I highly recommend [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to anyone who is serious about learning programming — it’s the best structured, free resource I’ve found.
