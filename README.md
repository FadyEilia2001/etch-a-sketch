# Etch-a-Sketch ðŸŽ¨

## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Fady! I decided to learn programming because Iâ€™m genuinely passionate about it. Iâ€™m not planning to change careers, but I wanted to challenge myself and grow by picking up coding alongside my day job and dad duties.

While my code may look rough at times, Iâ€™m fully committed to learning and improving. Iâ€™m currently building this project while at **92% completion of The Odin Project Foundation course**.

I highly recommend [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to anyone who is serious about learning programming â€” itâ€™s the best structured, free resource Iâ€™ve found.
